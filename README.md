Hi, there is my useful powershell command repository. 

Here you can find some tips and tricks. 

Before using these scripts, make sure to have a recent Powershell version and to execute the followind command:

Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force

*USE THEM ONLY IF YOU ARE ABLE TO. I DECLINE EVERY RESPONSIBILITY.*
